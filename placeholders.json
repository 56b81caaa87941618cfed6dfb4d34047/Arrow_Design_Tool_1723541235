    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_1": "What materials are needed to make arrows?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_1": "The main materials needed are arrow shafts (typically wood, aluminum or carbon), fletching (feathers or plastic vanes), arrowheads or points, and adhesives for attaching the components.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_2": "How do you fletch an arrow?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_2": "Fletching involves attaching the feathers or vanes to the rear of the arrow shaft in a spiral pattern. This provides stability and aerodynamics during flight. Proper offset and helical clocking are important.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_3": "What types of arrowheads are used?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_3": "Common arrowhead types include field points for target practice, broadheads for hunting, blunts for small game, and specialized heads like judo points. The choice depends on the intended use.",
    "ACCORDION_QUESTION_4": "How do you determine the correct arrow spine?",
    "ACCORDION_ANSWER_4": "Arrow spine refers to the arrow's stiffness which must match the bow's draw weight and length. Using an arrow chart or spine tester is recommended to ensure the arrows flex and recover properly upon release.",
